![LeafWay Logo](/static/leaf.png)

## Overview

LeafWay is an eco-friendly transportation predictor web application designed to help users make smarter, greener transportation choices. By analyzing factors such as distance, route type, and time of day, LeafWay recommends the most environmentally friendly transportation options for your journey and provides detailed CO2 emission estimates.

## Features

- **Smart Transportation Predictions**: Utilizes machine learning to predict the most suitable transportation mode for your trip
- **CO2 Emission Tracking**: Provides detailed CO2 emission estimates for different transportation methods
- **Cost-Effective Suggestions**: Helps identify budget-friendly transportation alternatives
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design with responsive layout for both desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: Personalized viewing experience with theme preference memory
- **Interactive Results**: Visualizes transportation options ranked by suitability and environmental impact

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, joblib
- **Data Processing**: pandas for data manipulation and analysis

## Model

The transportation mode prediction model is trained on a dataset that includes:
- Distance of the journey (in kilometers)
- Route type (Urban or Rural)
- Time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)

The model predicts the most suitable transportation mode from the following options:
- Walking
- Bicycle
- Bike (Motorbike)
- Bus
- Car

Each mode is associated with CO2 emissions data to help users make environmentally conscious decisions.

## Customization

- **Adding New Transportation Modes**: Update the `vehicle_to_co2` dictionary in `app.py` with new modes and their emissions data
- **Changing the Theme**: Modify the CSS variables in the `:root` and `.dark-theme` selectors in the HTML files
- **Updating Predictions**: Enhance the dataset and retrain the model using `train_model.py`
